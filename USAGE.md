## Usage

Use the KtForm application to bootstrap and manage infrastructure.

It's cumbersome to provide Java SE Swing desktop apps, so we're using JVM desktop KMP distribution only for containerized builds.    
Everything else is shipped either as Node.js or kotlin-native app to keep builds lean. 

## Containerized

### Docker
```bash

```

### Podman / NerdCtl
```bash

```

## Android

We ship the official build to [Play Market]().

## iOS

As well as [Apple Store]().

## MacOS

You can use both HomeBrew and [Apple Store]().

## Linux

### Arch Linux ktform
```bash
